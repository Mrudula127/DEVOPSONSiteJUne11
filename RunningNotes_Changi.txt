Operations:

IT team

DEVOPS:CI+CD
DEVOPS=DEV+OPS(operations teams responsibilities)

Nightly Build:suitable mainly fr water fall approaches
Developer will write code in eclipse
Devlopers commits code to code repo using git.
On every day in between 6pm to 8pm,servers will pull ur code from git
and will build your code.

   Disadvantage:per day u can run only one build.

CI(continous Integration):Agile or Scrum methodologies

Developer will write code in eclipse
Devlopers commits code to code repo using git.
WHen ever new code arrives in code repo,server will automatically
