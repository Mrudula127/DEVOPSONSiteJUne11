  DEVOPS(MCI,MCD),DEVOPS can be implemented on Scrum and agile.

CI,CD
       DEVOPS=Development team +Operations TEam(Depolyment/IT/Hosting)
    Continous integration/Delivery and continous code quality testing

per a day,only 1 time

Angular----Angu2--june18
sep-Ang4,dec-Ang5
     java----1.6,17,18,19


   man power/Automation tools,DEVOPS is not framework.Programming 

language.DEVOPS is Software culture.

--------------------------------------------
 DEVOPS ENgineer

Distributed Databases/Agile method and more no of tools.

 DEVOPS=CI+CD
  
  CI=TDD+tools,CD=BDD+tools

CI=====DEVELOPERS,   CDBDD====BA/Functional consultant 

guys/Archjitects/Managers/Delivery.


Identifying right tool for devps is most challenging in market....:(


1)approaches,architecture,Budget,scope and no of years.
  
    Whther it is competable to integrate,Security concern,UI...

    R&D team,DEVOPS Architect/Solution architect/Customers/We can 

decide.  Example:NN group.Customer is providing tools.

 RAML in mulesoftESB's.   github ---2 flavours1 public/private


Java testing:junit/Mockito/power mockito/Testng/Qunit
  Testers:Selenium
  Javascript:Karma/Jasmine/Mocha/.js
  BDD:Cucumber/specflow
  Python:pytest

   DEVOPS is not restricted to java and .net.
  Devops is for all programming languages.


   Config manage:Puppet/chef/Salt/ansible

What is config management?

Artifact Management:  artifact=Dependency

   ojdb14.jar  1)maven 2)manual aproach

  From security prospective Public(exa:Bustop)/private(Ex:Capgemini)?

If u use any URl,u r accessing a jar file available in public repo.

i need to trust only verified jars.Solution)Corporate repository

1) Identify ur dependencies
2)Verify the dependencies from Security and other prospectives
3)Make available to the team mates(by placing in corporate repo

(intranet)).
To create a corporate repo,we need to use nexus sonatype tool.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day2:
Maven and nexus sonatype artifact repo.

zipkin monitoring tool for microservices
Monitoring tool:
    sentry----python
	Zipkin---Microservices
	Pivotal cloud foundry/AWS----new reliac(service which is freely available as a part of pcf)
	java----elastic search/kibana/splunk/logstack/appdynamics

	
ORchestration &Scheduling module:used for scheduling your tasks and designing composite webservices.
Long and latitude.
  if one webservice is dependentt on another webservice.
  Ex:Googl maps is interacting with another internal webservice which will fetch lat*long.
      1 services is fetching lat*long based on source and dest.
	  1service-=fetc lat*long
oher=displaying route location on map.


MAven:is a build tool
1)We can manage dependencies(Dependency management)
2)Scaffolding can be done(Creating project Structure)
3)Automatic Deployment can be performed.
---
4)Plugin management
5)Repository management
6)Bundle creations for your OSGI environment made easy.
Questions)r u able to add plugins in eclipse?  yes
         2)r u able to add plugins in eclipse without restarting or exiting ur eclipse?  yes  
		 
		 Ans)It is not maven.It is because of Bundles.Bundle is similarly like a jar file but with additional capabilities.(Hot /cold installation of plugins).To undertsnad bundle,u shld be v v v v good at JAr concepts.
		 JAR Disadvantage:No Enough Dynamics Class loading capabilities.
		 
		 In coming years;u will not see jars ,u will see bundles.
		 
		 To run java programs,we need JVM.TO run Bundle,we need OSGI Engine.
		 Example for OSGI engines:Apache felix,Eclipse standard/Equinox
		 
		 PRogramming toools using OSGI:Jboss Fuse/Apache camel.
		 
		 Bundles can also be used for designing IDE tools and AutoDeployment.
		 
		 
		 

7)Transtive dependency management:if one dependency is dependenyt on another dependency.Then it is called as transtive dependency.
Exa: class A
{
}
class B extends A
{
}

B obj=new B();How many classes are there in B(except Object class)?  2

Dependency A
Dependency B uses internally A......then Which one is transtive dependency?A

A--dep1
B--dep2
C--dep3
D--depends on A & B======>2 transtive dependencies.Sol)

PAckaging(jar/war/ear)
8)PAcking of ur code(Jar/war/ear)
9)Maven can download dependencies automatically.Maven will fetch dependencies from following locations
1)Local repository
2)Corporate repo
3)Remote repo
4)Public/Central repo
Maven uses one configuration file(POM.XML).
How maven runs ur app?Ans:Based on maven lifecycle.
Instead of pom.xml can i have pom.html ans)no
html is for UI.Note:Configuartions can be in 3 waays 1)xml 2)Annotations 3)JSOn approach
oject one pom.
Note:POM to POM inheritance is possible.

10)Profiling(UAT/PRePROD/Prod)
2 cases:1)IF u r selecting maven project,trhen maven will create project structure for u.
        2)If you are not selecting maven or gradle;then by default ANT comes into picture.
		
		Eclipse IDE by default uses ANT tool.
		ANT/Maven/GRADLE

maven------->local repo(C:\Users\USername\.m2)---->corporate repo(nexus)---remote/public repo(mvn repository)

POM.xml consists of maven commands.
Eclipse is bundled with maven.

GroupiD---packagename
Artifact ID----Projectname

I need to work on A project named as JDBCMysql Project.

Ineed to add below dependencies:mysql connector,log4j,junit


Along with ur answers,if project migrations ocur,then will it create a problem?


we need to use maven.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Day3
  
  Maven is having one more config which is called as setting.xml file.
  app level---pom.xml file
  aat workspace level ---setting.xml file(can be used for below purposes.)
    1)U can provide proxy infor in this file
	2)U can also provide ur repository information
	3)U can also change local repo file system location from this setting.xml
	4)security can also be provided from setting xml file for local repo........etc
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Day4:
	
	All features we r going to configure in POM.xml.
	corporate repo can be supplied in 2 files:1 is pom.xml 2)setting.xml
	
	we shld not config transtive dependencies/dependencies in setting.xml.
	Localrepo====c:\\User\skolapar\\.m2
	
	There is no D: drive ur PC's
	U r connected to diffirent n/w.
	By default eclipse uses ,JRE.
	But maven expects JDK\JRE.  By default all browsers uses JRE,but not JDK.
	
	Troubleshotting tech for Maven:
	-------------------------------
	1)Missing artifact means there is no jar with the specified version.Sometimes there is change of jar archiving by vendor.
	2)if u any maven issue(but without error in pom.xml);u need to do force updayte.
	right click on project--->maven--->Update project--->Force Update
	3)Still if issue is not fixed,then 1)Simply remove .m2 folder.
	                                   2)If u r facing any challenges even after performing above tasks
									   then simply switch to new workspace.
	
	
	Precautaions:1)Always Crosscheck your setting.xml and Pom.xml for validness.
	2)Paths shld be valid irrespective of OS.
	3)always cross check type of extensions ur using fr ur files.("setting.xml")
	4)Dont use flatfiles(no txt file) for configuration.
	5)Define relationships between parent and child pom in proper way.
	6)Cross check ur Corporate repo path for validness.if needed u need to provide proxy info fr ur n/w.
	7)U need to have valid internet connectivity.
